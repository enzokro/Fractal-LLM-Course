If we can be so bold: our Agent will be a Jarvis-lite, laser-focused on a narrow scope.

    "#### Silent Failures in AI Models\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs, and Machine Learning models more generally, often fail in different ways than other, standard software fails. For instance, classic bugs in regular software include: type mismatches, syntax errors, compilation errors, etc. In other words failures that clearly stem from a *wrong* operation (aka a bug) that snuck into the code. We wanted the computer to do `X`, but we told it by accident to do `Y` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ML models often have \"silent\" failures. There is no syntax or compilation error - the program still runs and completes fine. But, there is *something* wrong in the code: adding where we should have subtracted, grabbing the wrong element from a list, or using the wrong mathematical function. There is no type checker or compiler that would (or even could, for now) catch these errors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The fix for the silent failures above is clear:  \n",
    "- Carefully inspecting the code.  \n",
    "- Monitoring and validating its outputs.  \n",
    "- Clarity in both the algorithms and models we are using.   \n",
    "\n",
    "There is another, unfortunate kind of silent failure: `version` mismatches. Version failures happen when we use a different version of a programming library than the version originally used by the model. As the software libraries we rely on are frequently updated, both subtle and major changes in their internals can affect the output of a model. These failures are unfortunately immune to our careful logical checks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding these silent failures is the main reason for being consistent and disciplined with our model's programming environment. A good environment setup keeps us focused on the important, conceptual part of our model instead of getting bogged down in managing software versions. \n",

A setup to bring in groundbreaking improvements as they are released. And to weave in the latest and greatest models. The LLM world is our oyster, and the base environment the grain of sand soon-to-be pearls. \n"
